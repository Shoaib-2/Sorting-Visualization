# Sorting-Visualization
The overall aim of the project is to design and implement a computer-based system to support lecturers and students on an algorithm design course, via a user-friendly interface and visualisation. The system should provide assistance during lectures and tutorials. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Project Objectives:
The project objectives are as follows:
1.	To help in learning sorting algorithms by implementing four types of algorithms, selection, insertion, bubble, and merge sort, using JavaScript. 1
2.	To help in learning searching algorithms by implementing two types of algorithms, linear and binary search, using JavaScript.
3.	Visualization of the algorithms.
4.	Designing of the GUI (Graphical User Interface).
5.	Allowing the user to enter data. 
6.	To implement control providing the user with buttons using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet).
7.	Using the bubble sort and merge sort for comparison of time efficiency.

Description: 
This project entails searching for data and sorting data which are fundamental algorithmic problems. Searching refers to iterating over the data structure’s elements to retrieve data whereas sorting refers to putting the data structure’s elements in order. 1 The project will design a system which supports teaching of sorting algorithms using JavaScript. The system will show the sorting in an animated and visualized manner. The project will use Visual Studio Code as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the development. 

The objective is to help with the difficulties that arise in comprehending algorithms in a visually pleasing manner so that a student can easily understand what sorting is during the tutorials or classes provided by the lecturer. The aim is to implement a simple system which helps students to learn what algorithms are as well as implementing algorithms which sort numbers in the ascending or descending order. The searching algorithm uses linear and binary search. If a student or a user types a number, in the input bar provided, it then iterates through the sorting algorithms, and which then identifies the given number, while visually representing this through bars. 

The main focus is to implement algorithms such as selection, insertion, bubble, and merge sort. Through the use of buttons (which will be programmed using HTML and CSS)2 the student can interact with the learning tool. This tool will also have extra features such as controlling the speed of the algorithm. This means that the student will be able handle the speed of the algorithm according to their understanding. The system will allow changing the size of the array and generating random numbers for the arrays using the GUI.  For example, data can be visualised as a bar graph, and therefore make it simpler to comprehend the algorithm. By inducing different colours for different algorithms, a student or a lecturer can easily identify which algorithm is running.


Initial areas of research:
•	Learning JavaScript.
•	Implementing sorting algorithms using JavaScript.
•	Implementing searching using binary and linear search with JavaScript.
•	Using HTML and CSS for visualisation.3
•	Researching about using different sorting systems.
•	Researching about how to visualize different algorithms in JavaScript.

Expected outcomes:
By the end of project, the complete system designing of the searching and sorting algorithm with animation and visualization will be completed with extra features to make it user friendly and intuitive for lecturers and students.
